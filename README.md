# File-Access-Permission-Project

//Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for File Access Permission Project

Introduction:
File Access Permission Project is a software system designed to manage access control and permissions for files and directories in a computer network. The system provides a secure way of protecting files from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion. This document outlines the requirements for the development of this project.

Scope:
The system will allow users to set up access control lists (ACL) for files and directories. The ACL defines which users or groups can access, modify, or delete the files. The system will provide an easy-to-use interface to manage the ACLs, and it will be compatible with popular operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.

//Functional Requirements

3.1 User Management
The system shall allow administrators to create and manage user accounts. Each user account shall have a unique username and password.

3.2 Access Control Lists
The system shall allow users to set up access control lists for files and directories. Each ACL shall define which users or groups can access, modify, or delete the files.

3.3 File Management
The system shall provide an interface to manage files and directories. Users shall be able to upload, download, create, delete, and move files and directories.

3.4 Audit Trail
The system shall maintain an audit trail of all file access attempts. The audit trail shall include the username, date, time, and action performed.

3.5 Reporting
The system shall provide reports on file access attempts, access control lists, and user activity. The reports shall be exportable in CSV or PDF format.

//Non-functional Requirements
4.1 Security
The system shall use industry-standard encryption algorithms to protect user passwords and file data.

4.2 Performance
The system shall be designed to handle a large number of users and files. The response time for file operations shall be less than 5 seconds.

4.3 Reliability
The system shall be designed to minimize downtime and data loss. Backups shall be taken regularly, and the system shall be tested for reliability.

4.4 Scalability
The system shall be scalable to accommodate an increasing number of users and files. The system shall be designed to handle up to 100,000 users and 1 million files.

4.5 Compatibility
The system shall be compatible with popular web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. The system shall be compatible with popular operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Constraints:
The system shall be developed using open-source technologies such as Python, Django, and PostgreSQL. The system shall be deployed on a Linux-based server.

Assumptions:
The users of the system shall have basic computer skills, including web browsing and file management. The system shall be accessed through a web interface.

Dependencies:
The system shall depend on the availability of network connectivity and web browsers. The system shall depend on the availability of a Linux-based server for deployment.

Acceptance Criteria:
The system shall be tested against the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in this document. The system shall be accepted if it meets all the requirements and is approved by the stakeholders.
